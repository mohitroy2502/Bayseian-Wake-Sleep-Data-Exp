# Bayseian-Wake-Sleep-Data-Exp


We use data from a sleep tracking device that documents the sleep and wake cycle of an individual over a given period of time. To augment this data, we have estimated the likelihood that a person is asleep based on the condition of their bedroom light (on/off) and if his phone is charging (yes/no). Our objective is to use this data to create a model that returns the probability of the person being asleep at a given time. The final goal can be mathematically expressed as:

P(Sleeptime)
